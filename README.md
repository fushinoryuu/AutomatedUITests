# Automated UI Testing
This is the skeleton code to starting Selenium automation for a site. The skeleton uses OneExchange.com, but it can be easily updated to something else.

This repo also includes:
- Cake scripts to automate the building of the project and running the tests.
- NPM scripts to more easily:
  - Start a local Selenium Hub/Node: `npm run hub` or `npm run node`
  - Run the Cake scripts: `npm run build` or `npm run tests`
  - See descriptions in the console of what you can can do: `npm run help`
- A simple GUI that allows the user to add/update the test settings. More on this below.

**Note:** If you are planning on using the GUI in this project to edit/update your test settings, you have to save it to the root of your C: drive. If you are not going to use the GUI, then feel free to save the project wherever you like.

All documentation for the project can be found in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/fushinoryuu/SeleniumAutomationToolbox/wiki) of the project, and goes into detail on how to run the project/tests.
